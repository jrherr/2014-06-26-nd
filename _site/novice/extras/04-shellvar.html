          <h1>Shell Variables</h1>
          
          <p>The shell is just a program, and like other programs, it has variables.
Those variables control its execution,
and by changing their values,
you can change how the shell and other programs behave.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start by running the command <code>set</code> and looking at some of the variables in a typical shell session:</p>

<pre><code>$ set
COMPUTERNAME=TURING
HOME=/home/vlad
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOSTNAME=TURING
HOSTTYPE=i686
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4
OS=Windows_NT
PATH=/Users/gwilson/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
PWD=/home/vlad
UID=1000
USERNAME=vlad
...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there are quite a few&mdash;in fact, four or five times more than what&#39;s shown here.
And yes,
using <code>set</code> to <em>show</em> things might seem a little strange,
even for Unix,
but if you don&#39;t give it any arguments,
it might as well show you things you <em>could</em> set.</p>

<p>Every variable has a name.
By convention, variables that are always present are given upper-case names.
All shell variables&#39; values are strings, even those (like <code>UID</code>) that look like numbers.
it&#39;s up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary.
For example, if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had,
it would convert the value of the <code>NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS</code> variable from a string to an integer.</p>

<p>Similarly, some variables (like <code>PATH</code>) store lists of values.
In this case, the convention is to use a colon &#39;:&#39; as a separator.
If a program wants the individual elements of such a list,
it&#39;s the program&#39;s responsibility to split the variable&#39;s string value into pieces.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have a closer look at that <code>PATH</code> variable.
Its value defines the shell&#39;s <a href="../gloss.html#search-path">search path</a>,
i.e., the directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs.
If you recall, when we type a command like <code>./analyze</code> that has a specific directory in the path,
the shell runs the program that path specifies.
Similarly, if we type <code>/bin/analyze</code>, the shell runs that specific program:
we&#39;ve provided a specific path, so it knows what to do.
But which one should the shell do if we just type <code>analyze</code>?</p>

<p>The rule is simple:
the shell checks each directory in the <code>PATH</code> variable in turn,
looking for a program with the requested name in that directory.
As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.</p>

<p>To show how this works, here are the components of <code>PATH</code> broken out one per line:</p>

<pre><code>/Users/gwilson/bin
/usr/local/git/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>

<p>On our computer, there are actually three programs called <code>analyze</code> in three different directories:
<code>/bin/analyze</code>, <code>/usr/local/bin/analyze</code>, and <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>.
Since the shell searches the directories in order, it finds the one in <code>/bin</code>, not either of the others.
Notice that it will <em>never</em> find the program <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>,
since the directory <code>/users/vlad</code> isn&#39;t in our path.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s show the value of the variable <code>HOME</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo HOME
HOME
</code></pre>

<p>That just prints &quot;HOME&quot;, which isn&#39;t what we wanted.
Let&#39;s try this instead: <code>echo $HOME</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $HOME
/home/vlad
</code></pre>

<p>The dollar sign tells the shell to replace the variable&#39;s name with its value.
This works just like wildcards:
the shell does the replacement <em>before</em> running the program we&#39;ve asked for.
Thanks to this expansion, what we actually run is <code>echo /home/vlad</code>,
which displays the right thing.</p>

<p>Creating a variable is easy: just assign a value to a name using &quot;=&quot;:</p>

<pre><code>$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY
Dracula
</code></pre>

<p>To change the value, just assign a new one:</p>

<pre><code>$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY
Camilla
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to set some variables&#39; values automatically every time we run a shell,
we can put the command to do this in a file called <code>.bashrc</code> in our home directory.
(The &#39;.&#39; character at the front prevents <code>ls</code> from listing this file
unless we specifically ask it to using <code>-a</code>:
we normally don&#39;t want to worry about it.
The &quot;rc&quot; at the end is an abbreviation for &quot;run control&quot;,
which meant something really important decades ago,
and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.)
For example, here are two lines in Vlad&#39;s <code>.bashrc</code> file,
which is in <code>/home/vlad/.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup
</code></pre>

<p>These two lines create the variables <code>SECRET_IDENTITY</code> and <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>,
give them values,
and export them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well.
Notice that <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>&#39;s definition relies on the value of <code>TEMP_DIR</code>,
so that if we change where we put temporary files,
our backups will be relocated automatically.</p>

<p>While we&#39;re here,
it&#39;s also common to use the <code>alias</code> command to create shortcuts for things we frequently type.
For example, we can define the alias <code>backup</code>
to run <code>/bin/zback</code> with a specific set of arguments:</p>

<pre><code>alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes.</p>
